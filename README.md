# bashera
An old bash script I wrote a couple of years ago. Thought I'd put it here on github. It's not maintatined anymore due to the lack of time, so other program like coursera-dl are more recommended.

# Description
Downloads course lectures (videos and pdfs) from Coursera

# How to use:
 ./coursera [COURSE_NAME] [COOKIES_FILE] [OUTPUT_DIR]  
Example:  
./coursera eqp-003 ~/lab/cookies.txt ~/Videos/Coursera/Quantum  
 
You can generate the cookies file by using a browser extension that
export cookies and save them into a txt file

# Features to add in future versions:
Ability to download pptx
 
# CHANGELOG
 
## version v1.01
 fixed pdf issue
 
## version v1.00
 The script is nearly complete, this version include folder classification
 as well as pdf download and subtitles download though still a very minor bug
 in the pdf download but I'll be working on it in the future.
